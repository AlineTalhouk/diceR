Description: Performs cluster analysis using an ensemble
    clustering framework, Chiu & Talhouk (2018)
    <doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1996-y>.  Results from a diverse set of
    algorithms are pooled together using methods such as majority voting,
    K-Modes, LinkCluE, and CSPA. There are options to compare cluster
    assignments across algorithms using internal and external indices,
    visualizations such as heatmaps, and significance testing for the
    existence of clusters.
