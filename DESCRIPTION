Description: Performs cluster analysis using an ensemble clustering framework.
    Results from a diverse set of algorithms are pooled together using methods
    such as majority voting, K-Modes, LinkCluE, and CSPA. There are options to
    compare cluster assignments across algorithms using internal and external
    indices, visualizations such as heatmaps, and significance testing for the
    existence of clusters.
