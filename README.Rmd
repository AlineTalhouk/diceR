# ClusterDuck

The goal of `ClusterDuck` is to provide a automated pipeline for ensemble clustering.

## Installation

You can install ClusterDuck from github with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AlineTalhouk/ClusterDuck")
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the main workhouse function of the package, `ConClust()`:

```{r}
library(ClusterDuck)
data(hgsc)
x <- ConClust(hgsc, k = 4, reps = 10, method = "hcAEucl", save = FALSE)
str(x)
```
