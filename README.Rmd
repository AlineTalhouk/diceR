# diceR

The goal of `diceR` is to provide pipelines for generating diverse cluster ensembles in R.

## Installation

You can install `diceR` from github with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("AlineTalhouk/diceR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the main workhouse function of the package, `ConClust()`:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(diceR)
data(hgsc)
x <- ConClust(hgsc, k = 4, reps = 10, method = "hcAEucl", save = FALSE)
```

```{r}
head(x[, , 1])
```
