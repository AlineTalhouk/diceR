EforClassRelabel.rda is that directly output from conClust. It had 117600 NAs in a total of 586800 data (about 20%). 

E_imputed_relabelled.rda is output after knnImpute and relabelling each layer according to output of consensusMatrix. No cross-layer relabelling was done
It had 6492 NAs, so about 1.1%. 

E_voted is output after majority voting of the 1.1% NAs. It has no NAs. 

X.rda is the raw gene data, rows are samples and columns are genes. 

Ignore other data files, they are just for testing and debugging.
