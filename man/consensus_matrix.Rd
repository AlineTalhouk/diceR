\title{Consensus matrix}
\usage{
consensus_matrix(data, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data matrix has rows as samples, columns as replicates}

\item{weights}{a vector of weights for each algorithm used in meta-consensus
clustering. Must have \code{length(weights)} equal to \code{ncol(data)}.}
}
\value{
a consensus matrix
}
\description{
Returns the (weighted) consensus matrix given a data matrix
}
\details{
Given a vector of cluster assignments, we first calculate the connectivity
matrix and indicator matrix. A connectivity matrix has a 1 if both samples
are in the same cluster, and 0 otherwise. An indicator matrix has a 1 if both
samples were selected to be used in a subsample of a consensus clustering
algorithm, and 0 otherwise. Summation of connectivity matrices and indicator
matrices is performed over different subsamples of the data. The consensus
matrix is calculated by dividing the aggregated connectivity matrices by the
aggregated indicator matrices.

If a meta-consensus matrix is desired, where consensus classes of different
clustering algorithms are aggregated, we can construct a weighted
meta-consensus matrix using \code{weights}.
}
\note{
When consensus is calculated over bootstrap samples, not every sample
is used in each replication. Thus, there will be scenarios where two
samples are never chosen together in any bootstrap samples. This typically
happens when the number of replications is small. The coordinate in the
consensus matrix for such pairs of samples is \code{NaN} from a 0 / 0
computation. These entries are coerced to 0.
