\title{Prepare data for consensus clustering}
\usage{
prepare_data(data, scale = TRUE, type = c("conventional", "robust",
  "tsne"), min.var = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data matrix with rows as samples and columns as variables}

\item{scale}{logical; should the data be centered and scaled?}

\item{type}{if we use "conventional" measures (default), then the mean and
standard deviation are used for centering and scaling, respectively. If
"robust" measures are specified, the median and median absolute deviation
(MAD) are used. Alternatively, we can apply "tsne" for dimension reduction.}

\item{min.var}{minimum variability measure threshold used to filter the
feature space for only highly variable features. Only features with a
minimum variability measure across all samples greater than \code{min.var} will
be used. If \code{type = "conventional"}, the standard deviation is the measure
used, and if \code{type = "robust"}, the MAD is the measure used.}
}
\value{
dataset prepared for usage in \code{consensus_cluster}
}
\description{
Perform feature selection or dimension reduction to remove noise variables.
}
\details{
We can apply a basic filtering method of feature selection that removes
variables with low signal and (optionally) scales before consensus
clustering. Or, we can use t-SNE dimension reduction to transform the data to
just two variables. This lower-dimensional embedding allows algorithms such
as hierarchical clustering to achieve greater performance.
